    "### It may be a good idead to decrease max_depth, because it will constrain the model\n",
    "# 4. If a Decision Tree is underfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try scaling the input features?\n",
    "### No, because decision trees don't care whether the training data is scaled or centered.\n",
    "# 5. If it takes one hour to train a Decision Tree on a training set containing 1 million instances, roughly how much time will it take to train  another Decision Tree on a training set containing 10 million instances?\n",
    "### The computational complexity is O(n × m log(m)), if we have 10 million instances, we need to multiply by 10 the training time. K = (n × 10m × log(10m)) / (n × m × log(m)) = 10 × log(10m) / log(m). If m = 106, the time is K ~ 11.7 hours.\n",

    "### Presort the training set only helps when we have a dataset smaller than a few thousand instances. With the training set of 100,000 instances, presorting will slow down training."
